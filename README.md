# Bioinformatics Research Topic: Distinguishing MS Patients from Controls based on T-cell receptor signature.

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of RNA sequence data. The data utilized for this analysis has been sourced from the experiment titled "Comprehensive Analysis of TCR-ÃŸ Repertoire in Patients with Neurological Immune-mediated Disorders" available on refine.bio.

### Scientific Question

The central scientific question of this project is: **"Do MS and HAM/TSP subjects have more similarities in gene expression than either of them with HC"**
The goal is to identify T-cell receptor signatures that are expressed differently between HAM/TSP, MS subjects and controls. 

## Data Description
The dataset used can be found at: 
https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP164913/comprehensive-analysis-of-tcr-s-repertoire-in-patients-with-neurological-immune-mediated-disorders

It includes RNA-seq data from TCR-$`\beta`$ profiles for 68 human samples. The experiment groups are: 18 HAM/TSP samples, 34 MS samples and 20 Controls samples.
